# Project: Bare Metal Forms and Helpers

This project will give you a chance to actually build some forms, both using nearly-pure HTML and then graduating to using the helper methods that Rails provides.

In this project, you‚Äôll build a form the old fashioned way and then the Rails way.

Additional description about the project and its features here:

[Project Steps](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/forms)

## Built With

- Languages: HTML, CSS, Ruby and JavaScript.
- Framework: RoR

## Live Demo

### Set up the Back End

- Build a new rails app (called ‚Äúre-former‚Äù).
- Create and migrate a User model with :username, :email and :password.
- Add validations for presence to each field in the model.
- Create the :users resource in your routes file so requests actually have somewhere to go. Use the :only option to specify just the :new and :create actions.
- Build a new UsersController (either manually or via the $ rails generate controller Users generator).
- Write empty methods for #new and #create in your UsersController.
- Create your #new view in app/views/users/new.html.erb.
- Fire up a rails server in another tab.
- Make sure everything works by visiting http://localhost:3000/users/new in the browser.

### HTML Form
The first form you build will be mostly HTML. Build it in your New view at app/views/users/new.html.erb. The goal is to build a form that is almost identical to what you‚Äôd get by using a Rails helper so you can see how it‚Äôs done behind the scenes.

- Build a form for creating a new user.
- Create the proper input tags for your user‚Äôs fields (email, username and password). 
- Submit your form and view the server output.
- Include your own authenticity token by adding a special hidden input and using the #form_authenticity_token method.
- Submit the form again.
- Go into your UsersController and build out the #create action to take those parameters and create a new User from them.
- Test this out.
- Continue with the steps indicated in the project to make improvements. [Steps](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/forms)


### Railsy Forms with #form_tag
Now we‚Äôll start morphing our form into a full Rails form using the #form_tag and tag helpers. There‚Äôs actually very little additional help that‚Äôs going on and you‚Äôll find that you‚Äôre mostly just renaming HTML tags into Rails tags.

### Railsy-er Forms with #form_for
#form_tag probably didn‚Äôt feel that useful ‚Äì it‚Äôs about the same amount of work as using <form>, though it does take care of the authenticity token stuff for you. Now we‚Äôll convert that into #form_for, which will make use of our model objects to build the form.

### Editing

- Update your routes and controller to handle editing an existing user. You‚Äôll need your controller to find a user based on the submitted params ID.
- Create the Edit view at app/views/users/edit.html.erb and copy/paste your form from the New view. Your HTML and #form_tag forms (which should still be commented out) will not work ‚Äì they will submit the form as a POST request when you need it to be a PATCH (PUT) request (remember your $ rake routes?). It‚Äôs an easy fix, which you should be able to see if you attempt to edit a user with the #form_for form (which is smart enough to know if you‚Äôre trying to edit a user or creating a new one).
- Do a ‚Äúview source‚Äù on the form generated by #form_for in your Edit view, paying particular attention to the hidden fields at the top nested inside the <div>. See it?
- Try submitting an edit that you know will fail your validations. #form_for also automatically wraps your form in some formatting (e.g. a red border on the input field) if it detects errors with a given field.


### Extra Credit
Modify your form view to display a list of the error messages that are attached to your failed model object if you fail validations. Recall the #errors and #full_messages methods. Start by displaying them at the top and then modify.
